This design employs a restrained material palette, predominantly utilizing concrete and metal, to create a neutral backdrop that accentuates the bonsai specimens.

At the terminus of the Bonsai Walls, a communal workshop space has been incorporated. This area serves a dual purpose: it functions as an educational facility for public bonsai cultivation classes and simultaneously provides an exhibition space for participants to showcase their creations.
